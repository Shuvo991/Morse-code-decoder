# assignment-3-team93
This assignment tests the performance of two platforms 
The first platform uses socket-io (client side) and bonescript(server side).
The second platform uses firebase (client side) and beaglebone-io (server side).

The main purpose of this spike plan is to discover which platform to be used in our future projects.

The spike plan observes what tools we used for the project and how we mitigated risks. 
The analysis report gives the overview of the project and gives a root to what we did to find the optimal combination of tools.
